What this phishing page does
==========================================
THIS PHISHING PAGE GETS YOUR LOGIN
INFORMATION TO STARBUCKS USING BASIC HTML
AND SOURCE CODE TO MAKE IT SO IT
LOOKS BELIEVABLE. THIS WEBSITE DOES THE
FOLLOWING:
[USER] logs into \*starbucks account
[WEBSITE] redirects to IP logger
[WEBSITE] IP Logs you
[WEBSITE] Sends login info to a .TXT file
[WEBSITE] Redirects you to a
phising page of starbucks
[WEBSITE] Once you click login and enter your login details, steals your account if we are online
[WEBSITE] Doesn't do anything with your credentials other than redirects you AGAIN once you press login to a "What Just Happened" page.
==========================================
